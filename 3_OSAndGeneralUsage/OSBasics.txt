+Terminal Usage:
Using a terminal allows us to send simple text commands to our computer to do things like navigate through a directory or copy a file,
and form the basis for many more complex automations and programming skills.
Windows: Although windows comes with ‘cmd’ you will need to download the tool ‘PowerShell’ in order to run any of the commands in this tutorial.
Linux: Most Linux distributions supply several, such as: gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm, rxvt, kvt, nxterm, and eterm.
No need to download anything, just read the help documentation for your distribution to see which one is included.

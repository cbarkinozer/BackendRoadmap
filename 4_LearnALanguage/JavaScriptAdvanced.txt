//I am interested in advanced concepts of java but while I just learned JavaScript, I decided to study advanced JavasScript(also its recommended by the roadmap).
//Study JS forms,objects,functions,classes,async,html dom, browser bom, ajax, json, web apis, js vs jquery

JS Forms:
Form validation:
If a form field(fname) is empty, the function alerts a message, and returns false to prevent the form from being submitted:

function validateForm() {
  var x = document.forms["myForm"]["fname"].value;
  if (x == "") {
    alert("Name must be filled out");
    return false;
  }
}

Automatic HTML Form Validation

HTML form validation can be performed automatically by the browser:
If a form fild fname is empty the required attribute prevents this form from being submitted:

<form action="/action_page.php" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="fname" required>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

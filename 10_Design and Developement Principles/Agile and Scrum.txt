Scrum Developement Methodolgy:
You can use waterfall method.
You can Plan 4x >Build 4x >Test 4x >Review 4x.

In scrum there are multiple sprints.
Sprint is each plan>build>test>review cycle.

Sprint1: 1x >Build 1x >Test 1x >Review 1x.
Sprint2: 1x >Build 1x >Test 1x >Review 1x.
Sprint3: 1x >Build 1x >Test 1x >Review 1x.
Sprint4: 1x >Build 1x >Test 1x >Review 1x.

Team members:

Product Owner : Decides what features should included(like idea finder).
Scrum master : Keeps the cycles going.
Team member: Who does the work at the sprint.
It is a more agile process.

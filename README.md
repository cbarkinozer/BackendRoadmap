# BackendRoadmap
The project has suspended.
Currently at step 7.
I am following this backend roadmap "https://roadmap.sh/backend".
First I will study purple ticked ones then at the end I will check the grey ticked ones.
I take notes in .txt files. I recommend you to follow the reference not my notes(because I tend to skip familiar concepts).

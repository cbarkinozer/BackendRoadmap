# BackendRoadmap
I am following this backend roadmap "https://roadmap.sh/backend" and taking notes about what I learned. <br/>
First I will study purple ticked ones then at the end I will check the grey ticked ones.<br/>
I take notes in .txt files. I recommend you to follow the reference not my notes(because I tend to skip familiar concepts).<br/>
The project has suspended. Currently at step 7.<br/>

Difference of class and id: A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.
Bookmarks and Links:
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.
To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.
Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.
Bookmark:
<a href="#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>
Link:
<a href="html_demo.html#C4">Jump to Chapter 4</a>

HTML Iframes:
An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
<iframe src="demo_iframe.htm" style="height:200px;width:300px;" title="Iframe Example"></iframe>

Javascript in HTML:
JavaScript makes HTML pages more dynamic and interactive.
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
</script>

File Paths:
A file path describes the location of a file in a web site's folder structure.
<img src="images/picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder in the current folder
<img src="/images/picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the images folder at the root of the current web
<img src="../picture.jpg">	The "picture.jpg" file is located in the folder one level up from the current folder

An absolute file path is the full URL to a file: <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="Mountain">

Head Element:
The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.
The <meta> element: Typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.
The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.
Define the character set used: <meta charset="UTF-8">
Define keywords for search engines: <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
Define a description of your web page: <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">
Define the author of a page: <meta name="author" content="John Doe">
Refresh document every 30 seconds: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
Setting the viewport to make your website look good on all devices: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Viewport: The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device (it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen).
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
Base: The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.
!The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.
!There can only be one single <base> element in a document!

Layout Elements:
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

Responsiveness:
Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones)
Examples:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="width:100%;">
<img src="img_girl.jpg" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;">
<h1 style="font-size:10vw">Hello World</h1>
!Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width

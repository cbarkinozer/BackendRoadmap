++JavaScript:

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: Fixed values and Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals. Variable values are called Variables.

Comment: Code after double slashes // or between /* and */ is treated as a comment.

Variables:
JavaScript ES6(after 2015) allows the use of the "const" keyword to define a variable that cannot be reassigned.
The "let" keyword to define a variable with restricted scope.

All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names called identifiers.
Names are case sensitive, reserved words cannot be used.
JavaScript identifies are case-sensitive.
Note: It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.

Constant Arrays:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];// You can create a constant array
cars[0] = "Toyota";                   // You can change an element
cars.push("Audi");                    // You can add an element
cars = ["Toyota", "Volvo", "Audi"];   // ERROR


Equal Type:
===	equal value and equal type
!==     not equal value or not equal type
==      equal to
!=      not equal to

typeof	        Returns the type of a variable
instanceof	Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

## ðŸ’» Day 3: Exercises

### Exercises: Level 1

1. Declare firstName, lastName, country, city, age, isMarried, year variable and assign value to it and use the typeof operator to check different data types.
```js
let firstName="barkin";
let lastName="ozer";
let country="Turkey";
let city="Ä°stanbul";
let age="20";
let isMarried=false;
let year=2023;

console.log(typeof firstName); //string
console.log(typeof lastName); //string
console.log(typeof country); //string
console.log(typeof city); //string
console.log(typeof age); //string
console.log(typeof isMarried); //boolean
console.log(typeof year); //number
```
2. Check if type of '10' is equal to 10
```js
console.log(typeof '10' == 10);//false
```
3. Check if parseInt('9.8') is equal to 10
```js
console.log(parseInt(9.8) == 10);//false
```
4. Boolean value is either true or false.
   1. Write three JavaScript statement which provide truthy value.
   2. Write three JavaScript statement which provide falsy value.

```js

console.log(typeof '10' == 10);//false
console.log(typeof '10' == 'number');//false

console.log(0 == ' ');//true
console.log('10' == 10);//true
console.log(typeof '10' == 'string');//true 
```
5. Figure out the result of the following comparison expression first without using console.log(). After you decide the result confirm it using console.log()

   6. 4 === 4
   7. 4 != 4
   8. 4 !== 4
   9. 4 != '4'
   10. 4 == '4'
   11. 4 === '4'
   12. Find the length of python and jargon and make a falsy comparison statement.

```js
console.log(4>3);//true

console.log(4<=3);//false
console.log(4==4);//true
console.log(4===4);//true
console.log(4!=4);//false
console.log(4!==4);//false
console.log(4!='4');//false
console.log(4==4);//true
console.log(4===4);//true
console.log('python'.length != 'jargon'.length); //false
```
6. Figure out the result of the following expressions first without using console.log(). After you decide the result confirm it by using console.log()
   1. 4 > 3 && 10 < 12
   2. 4 > 3 && 10 > 12
   3. 4 > 3 || 10 < 12
   4. 4 > 3 || 10 > 12
   5. !(4 > 3)
   6. !(4 < 3)
   7. !(false)
   8. !(4 > 3 && 10 < 12)

   console.log(new Date().getMonth()); //0
   console.log(new Date()); //2023-01-09T18:06:45.747Z
   console.log(new Date().getDay()); //1 (because sunday is 0)

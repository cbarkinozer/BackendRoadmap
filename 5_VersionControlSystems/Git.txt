++Git:
Version control systems allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state
review changes made over time see who last modified smth that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when and more.
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files multiple people.
Every user clones a copy of a repository(collection of files) ad has the full history of the project on their own hard drive.

Repository:
As known as repo is nothing but a collection of source code.
There are four fundamental elements in the Git Workflow.
Working Directory, Staging Area,Local Repository(Head) and Remote Repository(Master).
If you consider a file in your Working Directory it can be in three possible states.
It can be staged. Which means the files with the update changes are marked to be commited to the local repository but not yet comitted.
It can be modified. Which means the files with the updated changes are not yet stored in the local reposityor.
It can be commited. Which means that the changes you made to your file are safely stored in the local reposity.
git add: add a file that is in the working directory to the staging area.
git commit: add all files that are staged to the local repository.
git push: add all comitted files in the local repository to the remote repository. So in remote repo all files and changes will be visible
to anyone with acces to the remote repo.
git fetch: get files from the remote repo to the local repo but not in the working directory.
git merge get the files from the local repo into the working directory.
git pull get files from the remote repo directly into the working directory. Equivalent toa git fetch and a gi merge.
